                        <h2>History of the Nigeria Petroleum Industry</h2><br>
                        <p>Oil was discovered in nigeria in 1956 at Oloibiri in Niger Delta after half a century of exploration. The discovery was made by Shell-BP, at the time the sole concessionaire.<br>Nigeria joined the ranks of oil producers in 1958 when its first  oil field came on stream producing 5,100 bpd. After 1960, exploration rights in onshore and offshore areas adjoining the Niger Delta were extended to the other foreign companies.In 1965 the EA field was discovered by Shell in shallow water southeast of Warri
                        <br>In 1970, the end of the biafran war the coincided with the rise in the world oil price, and Nigeria was able to reap instant riches from its oil production. Nigeria joined the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1971 and established the Nigerian National Petroleum Company(NNPC) in 1977, a state owned and controlled company which is a major player in both the upstream and downstream sectors.<br>Following the discovery of crude oil by Shell D'Arcy Petroleum, pioneer production began in 1958 from the companies oil field in Oloibiri in the Eastern Niger Delta. By the late sixties and early seventies, Nigeria had attained a production level of over 2 million barrels of crude oil a day.Although production figures dropped in eighties due to economic slump, 2004 saw total rejuvenation of ol production to a record level of 2.5 million barrels per day. Current development of strategies are aimed at increasing production to 4 million barrels per day by the year 2010.
                    <br>Petroluem production and export play a dominate role in Nigeria's economy and account for about 90% of her gross earnings. This dominant role has pushed agriculture, the traditional mainstay of the economy, from the early fifties and sixties, to the background.<br>Major Events in the history of the Nigeria Oil and Gas<br><br>1908<br>Nigerian Bitumen  Co.& British Petroleum commenced operations around Okitipupa<br><br>1938<br> Shell D'Arcy granted Exploration license to prospect for the oil throughtout Nigeria.<br><br>1955<br>Mobil Oil Corporation started operations in Nigeria.<br><br>1956<br>First successful well drilled at Oloibiri by Shell D'Arcy.<br><br>1956<br>Changed name to Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited.<br><br>1957<br>First shipment of oil from Nigeria.<br><br>1961<br>Shell's Bonny Terminal Was commissioned.

NNPC commences retail outlet scheme.<br><br><br><h1>Economy of oil and Gas in Nigeria</h1><br>"The Oil and Gas (O&G) industry has continued to be the mainstay of the Nigeria economy despite Government's best efforts at diversification into Agriculture and Mining."<br>Even though the sector is less than 10% of the countru's GDP, it contribute about 65% of Government revenue and 88%bof Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings. It is no wonder that happenings in the industry tend to have an impact on the other sectors of the economy. It is, therefore, important for players in the Nigerian economy to continue to be aware of developments in the O&amp;G industry and monitor the happenings therein.<br>In October 2016, the Federal Government (FG) launched the 7 Big Wins Agenda with the overriding objective of creating a stable and enabling environment. The expectation is that it will  maximise investment opportunities in the sector and generate increased and sustainable growth in the economy. Consequently, the Government aspired to increase daily oil production to 2.8 million barrels (reduced from 4 million barrels the government had previously set as its 2010 vision). The Government also resolved to transform the country from an oil-based economy to a gas-based economy by developing gas infrastructure, commercializing gas flare, implementing a gas commercial frameworkand maximizing the use of gas to power economic development<br>There is no doubt that the Government is working to achieve the objectives of the 7 Big Wins Agenda.
                <br><br><br><h1>Benefits of oil and Gas in Nigeria</h1><br>"The oil and gas industry does more than meet the energy needs of the society. It create opportunity . It generate employment, boosts local businesses, drives crucial research and development, and promotes education and training, while generating and maintaining sustainable infrastructure."<br><br><h4>Quick Facts</h4><br>Directly employs more than 5,500 people (and thousands more indirectly). Supports more than 600 supply/service companies.<br> Cumulative expendititures by the producing sector in Atlantic Canada from 1997 to 2017 total more than $66.8 billion.<br>Cumulative royalties paid to the Government of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador from 1997 to 2017 more than $23.3 billion. <br>More than $506 million spent on research and development, and education and training. Offshore operators pay royalties and taxes to the provincial government in the province in which they operate. These payments directly support provincial government programs, and contribute to crucial services and infrastructure such as transportation, education and health care.<br>In addition, oil and natural gas activity leads to economic benefits for other industries, such as (but not limited to) construction and retail. Several years ago a study was conducted to better understand the socio-economic benefits of oil and natural gas industry activity in Newfoundland and Labrador. That stuy found that industry activity resulted in major socio-economic benefits, including significant increases to personal income and labour income, new housing starts in the province, and signifcant indirect and induced employment."</p>
